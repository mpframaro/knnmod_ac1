# Modifications to the K-NN algorithm for better handling of noise and outliers

This project was done for a second year curricular unit (Aprendizagem Computacional I).

Using Python, I implemented modifications to the base K-Nearest Neighors algorithm, in order to obtain better results when used in datasets with noise and/or outliers!<br>
The modifications were:
- Detection and exclusion of outliers
- Weighting of neighbors according to distance
- Overall data pre-processing upgrades
